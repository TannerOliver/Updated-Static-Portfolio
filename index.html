            About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am a student attending the Uniersity of Minnesota's full-stack flex bootcamp. So far I have learned some HTML, CSS and a little bit of Javascript. I decided to attend this bootcamp because I wanted a change in my career. Previously I was working in sales at a pawn & gun store that had a primary focus on guns. It did not pay very well and was very repetitive and boring work.

            Growing up my family pawned me off to being the technology guy. Whenever they had problems with their electronics they came to me and thought I knew it all. So quickly I became interested in computers and built my first pc in highschool. I enjoyed it and it felt like building lego's but for an adult. Ever since then I have helpe many friends build there own PC and ultimately just became interested in possibly learning how to build softwares.
